# Project Readme - AI-Based Predictive Software for Payment Amount Prediction

## Overview

This collaborative project, in partnership with HighRadius Corporation Pvt. Ltd., focuses on developing an AI-based predictive model for forecasting payment amounts. Leveraging machine learning techniques, data analysis, and predictive modeling, the project integrates a comprehensive tech stack, including a database for data storage, JDBC for database connectivity, POJO (Plain Old Java Objects) for structured data representation, and ReactJS for implementing Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities.

## Project Files

- **1705706.war:** This is the deployable .war (Web Application Archive) file containing the AI-based predictive application for payments. The .war file encapsulates the project code, libraries, and configuration necessary for deployment in a web server environment.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Techniques:** The project employs advanced machine learning techniques to analyze historical data and predict delays in incoming invoices.

- **Data Analysis:** Extensive data analysis is performed on the dataset to identify patterns, trends, and relevant features that contribute to incoming payments.

- **Predictive Modeling:** The predictive model is built using algorithms to ensure accurate forecasting of payments.

- **Database Integration (JDBC):** Utilizes JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect the application to a database for efficient data storage and retrieval.

- **POJO (Plain Old Java Objects):** Implements POJO for structured representation of data, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

- **ReactJS for NLP:** Integrates ReactJS to implement Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, enhancing the system's ability to understand and interpret human language in the context of invoice-related data.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Deploy the .war File:**
   - Deploy the war file to a compatible web server environment.

2. **Access the Application:**
   - Once deployed, access the application through the appropriate URL, typically in a web browser.

3. **Input Data:**
   - Provide input data related to incoming invoices. This data will be used by the AI-based model for predicting delays.

4. **Generate Predictions:**
   - Trigger the prediction process to obtain forecasts for the delay of incoming invoices.
